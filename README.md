# Sales_Data_Analysis Project using MYSQL and PowerBI

I have done this project from Codebasics Youtube Channel, and i have followed step by step from the tutors Dhaval Patel sir and Hemanand Vadivel sir.

In this project building processs i have collected the dataset and "imported to the mysql workbench" then i have performed some of the Analysis using SQL queries in mysql and i have used some of the complex queries like joins, case statements, window functions etc.                                                                
After completing the analysis part in MYSQL i have connected MYSQL workbench to the PowerBI by providing credentials for further operations like :                                             
1. Cleaning process : Loading the tables to Transform Data for Cleaning data like removing the irrelavant data, nulls, duplicate values and formatting the data.     
2. Data Modelling   : In this Data Modelling view process i build some relations to the tables using primary key in the Fact table with the foreign keys in the                             dimension tables and we used "star Schema" in the process of Data Modelling where all other dimension tables and connected to the single fact                         table.
3. Data Processing  : In this Data Processing i have build certain measures of DAX functions for some calculations
4. Data Visualization    : In this i have build some of the visualization reports of some required data as our requirement i have used the key data reports like KPI                            Cards for getting total revenue for total sales, Filters for years, bar graphs for different products and  revenue by markets, line                                  charts for how the revenue was generated throughout the period.                                                                           
Finally i have generated some key insights like Top highest selling products, highest revunue generated by markets, which products were bringing the loss for the business, and where we can grow our business more by increasing our sales in different markets.                                                                       
I have generated an API parameter for checking by drilling down option that weather the sales wise,zone wise and customer revenue wise were meeting the profit target % by the markets wise or not using that particular API.
